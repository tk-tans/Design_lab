# A Scientific Approach of Violin Manufacturing and Plate Testing

## Overview:
1. Developed an engineering method for violin manufacturing that differs from the traditional Luthiers approach.
2. Employed software tools like Audacity for sound analysis, focusing on Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).
3. Compared the sound analysis with the original spruce used and drew conclusions on whether violin manufacturing using an engineering approach is feasible.
